<h2>Lecture one:</h2>
<p>There are two main types of Learning 
    <ul>
    <li>Supervised Learning
      <p>In  these kind of problems,we will predict correct         answers from given set of data.the problems can be         generally classified as two kinds</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Regression Plot
            <p>In this kind we will plot a continuous graph                and the solutions will be continuous</p>
        </li>
        <li>classification plot
         <p>in this kind the solutions will be discreet</p>
         </li>
        </ul>
    </p><p>In both these cases there can be many variables       </p>
        
    </li>
    
        <li>Unsupervised learning
            <p>These are Seperation Problems.We are given a bunch of unlabeled data
            <ul>Examples
                <li>Google news :Given a bunch of articles without saying anything about them.The site clusters them into particular stories</li>
                <li>Cocktail party .In which two voices are mixed and the algorithm seperates them into two different kinds</li>
                <li>Clustering Genomes of people.</li>
            </ul><p>In  all of these cases we are not labelling the data as anything.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Lecture Two:</h2>
<div class="two"><p>Given a bunch of data with labels.The learning algorithm takes the data and produces a function called Hypothesis:h(x)
    <p>where x1,x2,x3...Xm are the inputs and y1,y2,y3...Ym are outputs.h(x)takes inputs x1,x2.. to produce outputs y1,y2...</p>
    <p>we can make h(x) as a straight line.then we call this algorithm or method as Linear Regression. and on single variable x ,we can call this as univariate linear regression.</p>
